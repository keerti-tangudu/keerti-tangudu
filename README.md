# Hi 👋 I’m Keerti Tangudu

I’m a **DevOps & SRE Engineer with 4+ years of hands-on experience**, working across **AWS and Azure** to build reliable, scalable, and automated cloud platforms. I enjoy solving infrastructure problems, improving system reliability, and helping teams ship faster with confidence.

Most of my work revolves around **cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation, Kubernetes, and observability**, with a strong focus on Infrastructure as Code and operational excellence.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- Design and automate cloud infrastructure on **AWS and Azure**
- Build and maintain **CI/CD pipelines** for fast and reliable deployments
- Containerize applications using **Docker** and run them on **Kubernetes (EKS/AKS)**
- Implement **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform and Ansible
- Improve system reliability through monitoring, logging, and automation

## ☁️ Cloud Experience

### AWS
I’ve worked extensively with:
- EC2, EKS, ECR  
- VPC, Subnets, Route 53, NAT Gateways  
- S3, DynamoDB  
- CloudWatch, CloudTrail  

I use AWS to build secure, scalable infrastructure and automate everything using Terraform.

### Azure
On Azure, I’ve designed and managed:
- Virtual Machines, AKS, ACR  
- VNets, Subnets, NSGs, NICs  
- Blob Storage and Azure databases  

I also work with **IAM, RBAC, and Managed Identities** to implement secure access patterns.

## 🔁 CI/CD & Automation

- Create and maintain **multi-stage Jenkins pipelines**
- Work with **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps, and ArgoCD**
- Implement Git branching and release strategies
- Automate deployments across multiple environments
